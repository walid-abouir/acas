This environment is a custom environment designed to simulate a scenario where
two airplanes (ownship and intruder) are flying in a 2D plane. The goal is to 
avoid the collision between the airplanes by adjusting the heading of the 
ownship based on the relative position, speed, and heading of the intruder.

The environment is compatible with OpenAI Gym and can be used for reinforcement 
learning tasks. It includes methods for resetting the environment, taking a 
step in the environment, rendering the current state, and closing the environment.
